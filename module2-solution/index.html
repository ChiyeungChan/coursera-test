				<p>There are people you love, your hobbies, triumphs, successes, and happiness. There is so much more than stress and fear. Stress does not make you better and fear does not make you happier. Many women suffer from chronic stress because they let it happen. They let stress control their minds and thus their lives. Fear is a complicated thing, but human beings – especially we women – have enough power to keep it at bay.And that is the major reason to be emotionally strong. Show me at least one person in the world who has never had to handle problems – any types. There is no such a person. Both rich and poor people have problems – even animals face problems. Realize that life is not going to be completely happy and build an emotional stamina on a daily basis so that when a problem pops up, you are ready to tackle it without too much stress.</p>
